# Jira Integration Demo

This repository was created for training purposes to demonstrate integration between **Jira** and **GitHub**.  
It is used as a practice project for QA activities such as:

- Creating and managing issues in Jira (Tasks, Bugs).
- Linking commits and pull requests to Jira issues.
- Practicing bug reporting and task tracking workflow.
- Understanding the connection between development and QA processes.
- Writing and documenting **automated tests** (PHPUnit, Laravel) as part of QA practice.

## Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to serve as a **QA practice project**.  
It does not contain production-ready code but helps to show how QA work is organized in a real project environment.  

All training activities are based on a **real working project** â€“ [flyn.no](https://flyn.no/).  
This allows us to practice QA processes (manual testing, bug reporting, automated testing) in conditions close to a real production system.
